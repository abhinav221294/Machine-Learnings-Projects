Advanced House Price Regression
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.

General Information
You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

The company wants to know: -Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house? -How well those variables describe the price of a house?

Using GridSearchCV the model arrives at a final optimum lambda to determine the house prices using ridge and lasso regression.

Conclusions
On analysing data, it was observed that, the Ridge regression model was able to predict house prediction precisely with an R2 Score of more than 82% but Lasso also going equally well.
